# Machine-Learning-Basics
In this repository, different machine learning algorithms have been implemented using basic numpy library only.
The hard coded implementation of these algorithms is helpful in understanding the basic concepts and complexity behind these algorithms.

>I would be happy to hear any suggestions.
